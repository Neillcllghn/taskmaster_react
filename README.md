# TaskMaster - Frontend React.
TaskMaster is a responsive website allowing visitors to view on a range of devices. It allows users to create and edit tasks and categories when signed in.

I used the Responsive Viewer chrome extenstion to test the responsiveness on each web page which you can see below:

## User Experience (UX)

Welcome to TaskMaster, a web-based platform designed to streamline your task management experience. TaskMaster empowers users to efficiently organize their tasks into categories, assign titles and descriptions, set due dates, and mark tasks as urgent. This application is a fusion of a React frontend and a backend API.

### User Registration and Account Management

TaskMaster prioritizes user identity and account management. Users can register on the platform, which opens up a world of possibilities for creating and managing tasks and categories. Each task mandates a title, description, and a due date (with an enforced constraint that due dates cannot be set in the past). Users can also flag tasks as urgent with a simple checkbox. Categories play an essential role in organizing tasks; hence, users must create a category before adding a task.

### Task and Category Management

TaskMaster offers comprehensive control over your tasks and categories. Users can effortlessly edit or delete tasks and categories. However, it's worth noting that the platform employs a confirmation modal when deleting a task or category, ensuring that users make informed decisions.

### Personalized Experience

TaskMaster tailors the user experience to be personal and intuitive. Users can view, edit, and delete only the tasks and categories they've created. This approach fosters a clutter-free and focused workspace, enhancing overall productivity.

### Profile Customization

TaskMaster allows users to personalize their profiles, making them uniquely their own. Users can upload profile images, which will be prominently displayed on various pages, including the Task and Category Lists and the Navigation Bar. Additionally, users can update their usernames and passwords as needed.


#### Notable Features

- **Home Page Insights**: Users are greeted with a summary of incomplete and urgent tasks upon login, providing a quick overview of their workload.
- **Visitor-Friendly Introduction**: Users who are not logged in are presented with a clear description of the site's features and capabilities on the home page.
- **Sign Up and Login Pages**: Streamlined registration and login pages for ease of access.
- **Task Creation**: An intuitive form for creating tasks, ensuring all necessary information is provided.
- **Category Creation**: A straightforward form for creating categories to keep tasks organized.
- **Task and Category Lists**: Easy-to-navigate lists of tasks and categories.
- **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by completion status (incomplete/completed/urgent).
- **Search Functionality**: Robust search options on both Task and Category list pages.
- **Profile Customization**: A dedicated profile page for updating usernames, changing profile images, adding a bio, and modifying passwords.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

Colour scheme used was adopted from the [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/getting-started/introduction/). Images from [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/)

- Used for the Navigation Bar - Idea from [CSS Cookbook](https://themes.typepad.com/guide/navigation-bar/).

 ![image](https://github.com/Neillcllghn/test_taskmanager_react/assets/109948740/dcd7e42d-65b4-477d-9542-efb21d68b966)

- Used to identify The active icon on the Navigation Bar (nice contrast from the main color of the Navbar). Also used when the user moves the mouse over any create, save etc.:

![image](https://github.com/Neillcllghn/test_taskmanager_react/assets/109948740/124ac57f-9077-4886-b0fb-a3e6a2db1ddd)

- Used for the main heading TaskMaster and the Task and Category create forms to separate the forms from the rest of the background):

- The Edit and Delete Buttons are green (to notify user that this is to edit and same as the Navigation Bar colors) and red (which is suitable warning user that this is a delete button):

- - -

### Typography

The Font used is Poppins as it is well rounded, widely popular font that is suitable for both heading and body text.

- - -

### Imagery

I did not use any imagery at this time but will do so in later developments in the future

Here are the available props for the NavBar component:

- currentUser (optional): The current user object.
- setCurrentUser (optional): A function to handle user actions.
- expanded (optional): Control whether the navigation menu is expanded.
- ref (optional): A reference for handling click outside the menu.

Here are the available props for the `Asset` component:

- spinner (optional): Set to true to display a spinner animation.
- src (optional): Provide the image source URL.
- message (optional): Display a message below the asset.


#### Avatar Component

The `Avatar` component is a reusable component for displaying user avatars with optional text (Inspired by the CI walkthrough project: Moments).

**Usage**

#### CurrentUserProvider Component

The `CurrentUserProvider` component is a reusable component that provides a context for managing the current user's state and handling authentication-related actions (Inspired by the CI walkthrough project: Moments).

**Usage**

To use the `CurrentUserProvider` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `CurrentUserProvider` component at the top of your JavaScript or JSX file:

   ```javascript
   import { CurrentUserProvider } from './context/CurrentUserProvider';

2. Wrap your application or a specific part of your application with the `CurrentUserProvider` component:

```<CurrentUserProvider>
    {/* Your application components */}
   </CurrentUserProvider>
  

 **Context**
The `CurrentUserProvider` component provides two contexts:

- CurrentUserContext: This context contains information about the current user.
- SetCurrentUserContext: This context provides a function to set the current user.


#### UserProfileProvider Component

The `UserProfileProvider` component is a reusable component that provides a context for managing user profile information based on the current user.

**Usage**

To use the `UserProfileProvider` component in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `UserProfileProvider` component at the top of your JavaScript or JSX file:

   ```javascript
   import { UserProfileProvider } from './context/UserProfileProvider';

2. Wrap your application or a specific part of your application with the `UserProfileProvider` component:

```<UserProfileProvider>
  {/* Your application components */}
</UserProfileProvider>
  

 **Context**
The `UserProfileProvider` component provides a context named `UserProfileContext`, which includes the following:

- userProfile: The user's profile information.
- setUserProfile: A function to set the user's profile information.
- By using this context, you can access and manage user profile data within your application.
- 

#### useRedirect Hook

The `useRedirect` hook is a custom hook that enables redirection based on user authentication status. It's a versatile utility to handle user authentication redirects within your React application (Inspired by the CI walkthrough project: Moments).

**Usage**

To use the `useRedirect` hook in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `useRedirect` hook at the top of your JavaScript or JSX file:

   ```javascript
   import { useRedirect } from './hooks/useRedirect';

2. Call the `useRedirect` hook within a component where you want to handle redirects based on user authentication status. Pass the user authentication status as an argument:

```const YourComponent = () => {
  useRedirect(userAuthStatus);
};

Here, `userAuthStatus` can be one of the following values:
- `'loggedIn'`: Redirects to the homepage if the user is logged in.
- `'loggedOut'`: Redirects to the homepage if the user is logged out.


#### useClickOutsideToggle Hook

The `useClickOutsideToggle` hook is a custom hook designed to manage the toggling of a component when a click event occurs outside of it. It's useful for creating components that should expand or collapse when clicking outside of their boundaries, namely the Navigation Bar when the toggle (burger icon) appears on smaller screens (Inspired by the CI walkthrough project: Moments).

**Usage**

To use the `useClickOutsideToggle` hook in your React application, follow these steps:

1. Import the `useClickOutsideToggle` hook at the top of your JavaScript or JSX file:

   ```javascript
   import useClickOutsideToggle from './hooks/useClickOutsideToggle';

2. Call the `useClickOutsideToggle` hook within a component where you want to handle click events outside of a specific element. The hook returns an object containing state variables and a ref:
const YourComponent = () => {
  const { expanded, setExpanded, ref } = useClickOutsideToggle();

  // ...
};

- expanded: A boolean value representing the current toggle state.
- setExpanded: A function to programmatically set the toggle state.
- ref: A ref that should be assigned to the element you want to monitor for click events.

## Credits

### Code Used:

1. The code used in project (with regards the TaskList edit and delete buttons) was in part inspired by what was from the Youtube video titled: [Part 2 Frontend Design I Task Manager App with React (JS) + Django (Python)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc-sRIGWJY8).

2. The various leactures and notes - Code Institute walkthrough project React Frontend Walkthrough on the Moments was of great benefit and was the foundation for this project.

3. The button design and boarder for both the Task and Categories forms were influenced by the [Styling React Forms with CSS](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/css-learn-to-style-react-forms-with-css-2ce72c67c66f).


### Content:

1. The Code Institute walkthrough project Moments was of great inspiration with regards the profiles, and Navigation bar, redirect and userContext hooks etc.

2. All other content for the site, tasks and categories were written by myself.
